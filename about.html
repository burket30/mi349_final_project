            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>
                My name is Matthew Burkett and I'm a student at Michigan State University studying computer science. My
                career focus is on game development. It's something I love doing and I'm in the process of developing skills for
                it. The games that I've learned the most from include Minecraft, Subnautica, DOTA 2, LoL, Skyrim, and Endless
                Space 2. I'm most inspired to create by the author C.S. Lewis and his works.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Through this website, you can access projects that I've worked on or any in-progress games that are presentable.
                I hope to use this as a means to share the work I'm doing with potential employers, as I am looking for an
                internship or co-op opportunity during the summer of 2022. If you're interested in reaching out, please feel free
                to contact me using the information provided below.
            </p>
